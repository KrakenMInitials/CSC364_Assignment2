You can run 'run.bat' to simulate, but otherwise use /server.py and /client.py in a regular client-server way.

```
Existing channels:
   Common*
```


User can leave Common, but the channel server-side will not be removed.
User will not be able to say anything to Common until they've joined Common again
Minor bug: Common will always show up client-side as an existing channel.

/join <channel> will update local copy of channels innately
